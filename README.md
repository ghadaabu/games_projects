Memory_game

This Python Pygame memory game kicks off with users entering their names, initiating the unveiling of tiles. 

Players start with a score of 100, opting to reveal two tiles per turn. 

The game dynamically adjusts the score based on user decisions: successful matches earn extra points, while unmatched tiles incur a 5-point deduction. 

This blend of strategy and memory challenge ensures an engaging and concise gaming experience.
